I help protocol teams ship safer smart contracts by translating risk into clear security requirements, then driving execution across **formal verification**, **smart contract auditing**, and **security-in-production** practices.

## What Certora does
Certora is a smart contract security company focused on **preventing failures before they happen**, and helping teams operate safely after launch.

### Formal Verification (Certora Prover)
Certora’s flagship product is the **Certora Prover**, a formal verification engine that checks smart contracts against specifications (rules and invariants), exploring edge cases that tests and manual review can miss.

### Smart Contract Audits
Certora also delivers **smart contract audits**, with a differentiator: combining **manual auditing** and **formal verification guarantees** in one engagement/report.  [oai_citation:1‡certora.com](https://www.certora.com/audits?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Monitoring, Onchain + Offchain, and Incident Readiness
Security does not stop at “ship.” Certora actively pushes a lifecycle approach that includes **real-time monitoring** and operational readiness, including collaborations with monitoring leaders (for example, Certora’s partnership work with **Hypernative** for real-time monitoring and lifecycle assurance).

Certora has also published monitoring-oriented research and tooling such as **Safeguard**, focused on monitoring critical invariants in real time.  [oai_citation:3‡certora.com](https://www.certora.com/blog/safeguard?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Operational Security (OpSec)
A lot of protocol losses come from operational failure modes: key management, multisig hygiene, access control around sensitive systems, and process weaknesses. Certora publishes practical OpSec guidance and encourages modern approaches like zero-trust thinking for protecting teams and systems.

## What I do as a TAM
I partner with engineering and security teams to turn “we need to be secure” into an actionable plan and measurable outcomes:
- Partner with teams to define **security goals**, scope, and success criteria
- Translate protocol risks into **verifiable properties** and reviewable requirements
- Coordinate delivery across verification and audit workflows, keep comms tight and execution unblocked
- Help teams integrate verification into their **release and upgrade** process
- Support lifecycle posture: **monitoring strategy**, incident readiness, and practical OpSec habits

## Topics I care about
DeFi security, protocol design, upgrade safety, invariants, defense-in-depth, monitoring, and security operations.
